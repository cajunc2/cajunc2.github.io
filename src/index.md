Welcome to my "Operating Room." This space is dedicated to my efforts at "healing" older electronics. So much old technology is doomed to e-waste, but there's plenty to enjoy and a lot to learn from these old computers. These articles show a glimpse into some of my efforts to restore and enjoy some of the machines I've come across.
