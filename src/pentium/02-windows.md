# {{ title }}

I had been thoroughly enjoying all my DOS games.
I dabbled in Windows 3.1, although that didn't offer much to really entertain me beyond novelty.
Then I remembered one of my favorites of the mid-90s.

But that's a Windows 95 title. That means I have a decision to make.
The obvious choice is Windows 98 Second Edition, so naturally I went with Windows 95 OSR2.

Why Windows 95?

And that's all for now. Keep reading for more updates.
