Wandering around the consignment area of VCF East 2023, I spotted something that's been on my wish list for YEARS.
An InWin S500 ATX mid-tower case. It was in decent shape too! Marked $30 with a bad PSU? No-brainer, it was mine.

Turns out the guts weren't half bad either.
I replaced the bad PSU with a Corsair CX430 (also picked up at VCF for a couple bucks) and upgraded the ATi Rage 128 Pro to a GeForce 3.
I kept the old hard drive, but plopped in a known-good one for a fresh start. That's all it needed. The rest of it just took some deep cleaning and we were ready to rock!
