I found the Kaypro at the VCF East Swap Meet in Wall, NJ on February 26, 2022.
It was a bit of an impulse-buy, as I wasn't looking for a Kaypro in particular and in fact I didn't know much about them before I decided to buy.
The unit in question was being sold by the VCF organization as a way to clean out storage space and raise some funds for the organization.
Consequently, the computer was in pretty rough shape, having been neglected in storage for an unknown amount of time.

Clearly, this machine needed some attention!
With some evidence of potential water exposure and absolutely no clue about the condition of the internals, I didn't dare plug it in without doing a thorough inspection.
Surprisingly, when I popped the case, the internals looked pretty decent!

Of course, not EVERYTHING was picture-perfect in here.
My first stop was to check out the power supply.
As is typical for computers of this era, the power supply contained a few of the dreaded Rifa brand filter capacitors.
These are known to fail over time, producing clouds of noxious smoke when power is applied to the failed parts.
As you can see, these capacitors had seen better days and needed to be replaced before I went any further.

Replacement parts were ordered and I set about cleaning the case while I waited for shipping.
I'd say it cleaned up quite nicely, especially considering its condition when I got it.
Magic erasers and elbow grease were my helpers for this one.

And that's all for now. Keep reading for more updates.
