		<h1>Hello Pentium!</h1>
<p>It was a long day at the swap meet in Hunt Valley, MD in June of '22.
A few things had piqued my interest, but not enough to open my wallet.
Of course, my buddy was cleaning up. A Commodore 1702 monitor, a Pentium II system, a couple other goodies...</p>
<p>At least seeing the computer museum at <a href="https://museum.syssrc.com/" target="_blank">System Source</a> was worth the trip.</p>
<p>Alas, it was time to call it a day.
Vendors were all but packed up and gone.
One last swing past the &quot;free&quot; table on the way to the car.</p>
<p>What's that? A beige box?</p>
<p>It's a compact case, so not much expansion room, but it's free.
It's got a CPU, RAM, a hard drive, a NIC.
Totally worth the price!</p>
<p>I didn't have any floppies or any other 3.5&quot; drives, so installing from floppy is out of the question.
The machine had no optical drive (and I didn't have an extra), so burning CDs was also not an option.
Gotek to the rescue! Let's start with installing MS-DOS 6.22.</p>
<div><a data-gallery="page-photos" href="/images/pentium/1.jpeg" class="glightbox"><img src="/images/pentium/small/1.jpeg" class="fullwidth-photo nocaption" /></a></div>
<p>So DOS is all well and good, but that's not what we're here for, is it?</p>
<div><a data-gallery="page-photos" href="/images/pentium/doominstall.jpeg" class="glightbox"><img src="/images/pentium/small/doominstall.jpeg" class="fullwidth-photo nocaption" /></a></div>
<p>Much better!
It's a bit anti-climactic without any sound and with the tiny keyboard I had on hand, but the Pentium MMX 166 MHz processor and 96MB(!) of RAM check out fine.
To get things going for real, I desperately needed some sound.</p>
<p>Most would go SoundBlaster. It's the obvious choice. The standard.
Problem is they're a bit expensive and you've gotta find just the right one so it has the right features and no bugs (MIDI hanging note bug, anyone?).
Thankfully, there's a quality alternative in the ESS AudioDrive cards. In this case, the ES1869F.</p>
<p>It's SoundBlaster Pro compatible, so basically every DOS game works with no problem.
For music, it's the ESSFM, which is an excellent clone of the Yamaha OPL2.
It's also got a WaveBlaster header, which will come in handy eventually.</p>
<p>My brief time on eBay also led me to scratch an itch that's been bothering me since 1995.
It was time to get a REAL joystick.
In this case, the object of my teenage, Descent-playing lust: The CH Products F-16 CombatStick.</p>
<div><a data-gallery="page-photos" href="/images/pentium/joystick.jpeg" class="glightbox"><img src="/images/pentium/small/joystick.jpeg" class="fullwidth-photo nocaption" /></a></div>
<p>Now that the box was decked out with a decent soundcard and plenty of control options, I was set!
Many hours of Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, Descent, Sim City 2000, Kings Quest VI, TIE Fighter, and others commenced.
There was a brief flirtation with Windows 3.1, but DOS games were everything.</p>
