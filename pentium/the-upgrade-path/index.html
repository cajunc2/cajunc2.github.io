		<h1>The Upgrade Path</h1>
<p>As thoroughly enjoyable as the Pentium machine was, it did show its lack fo muscle in some respects.
Sim Copter was a bit of a slide-show, unless you played with lower detail settings.
Quake was pretty good at 320x200, but forget anything higher.
Newer titles like Unreal were just out of the question.</p>
<p>I could choose to be satisfied with the way it was, OR I could do what had to be done.
Time for some upgrades!</p>
<p>CPU selection was easy. The Pentium MMX 233 was the fastest of the line, so that's what I grabbed. Sure, I could've used any number of even faster K6-2 or -3 chips, but without the Super Socket 7's 100MHz bus, that's leaving a lot of performance on the table.</p>
<p>The CPU upgrade was a noticeable improvement.
Everything felt snappier. Sim Copter was now quite playable, even with higher detail settings.</p>
<p>I still had that itch for wavetable MIDI, so I headed over to <a href="https://www.serdashop.com">Serdashop</a> for a DreamBlaster X2GS.
That particular model has an officially-licensed Roland sound bank pre-loaded. It wouldn't sound EXACTLY like a SoundCanvas, but it's remarkably close.
It sounded fantastic and works perfectly with any game that supports General Midi output.</p>
<p>A CD-ROM drive made it easier to load software.
A Filco mechanical keyboard made typing a WHOLE lot nicer.
A Logitech Wingman Precision Gamepad... well... wasn't great, honestly.
It would eventually be replaced by an Interact MƒÅkoPad, which is quite good.</p>

<p>Still... the system wasn't quite perfect.
Newer titles like Quake and Unreal were still pretty tough.</p>
<p>This was the dawn of the era of 3D acceleration.
The system had an S3 Virge DX on-board, but that didn't really help matters much, so I largely ignored it.
Back in the day when I had this problem, I pestered my parents non-stop until they eventually gave in and got a Diamond Monster 3D for the family computer.</p>
<p>I knew a Voodoo card was the best option for the time period, but I really didn't want to pay the &quot;3Dfx tax&quot; that these cards command on the current market.
I waffled. I looked at other cards. I tried to justify things.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how it happened (total mystery, I swear) but a 4MB Diamond Monster 3D suddenly appeared in my mailbox.
Just like the one I had back in the 90s.
I wasted NO time popping that sucker in and getting drivers installed.</p>

<p>Ahhhhhhh...</p>
<p>What else could you want at this point?</p>
<p>And did you notice I snagged a bit of a monitor upgrade along the way too?
It's a Nokia 710C 17&quot; flat CRT with built-in speakers.
It matches the size of the desktop case perfectly and not needing external speakers is a real convenience.</p>
