		<h1>The Right OS</h1>
<p>I had been thoroughly enjoying all my DOS games.
I dabbled in Windows 3.1, although that didn't offer much to really entertain me beyond novelty.
Then I remembered one of my favorites of the mid-90s.</p>
<p>SimCopter.</p>
<p>But that's a Windows 9x title. That means I have a decision to make.
The obvious choice is Windows 98 Second Edition, so naturally I went with Windows 95 OSR2.</p>

<p>Why Windows 95?</p>
<p>Part of it is my silly desire to be different and to select the non-obvious choice.
Part of it is how much I enjoy the Internet-Explorer-free UI of Windows 95.
Part of it is just fitting the machine into a particular era.
By the time Windows 98 came out, the Pentium II was all the rage.
This Pentium MMX system would've been mostly obsolete.</p>
<p>It took some driver digging, as it typically does. Once I had all the hardware configured, the system was very stable. No hardware conflicts, everything working like it should. Time to take to the skies!</p>

<p>What a classic!
Of course, it's not the most well-optimized game and a Pentium 166 isn't a real screamer, but who cares about such things when the game is so good?!</p>
<p>As a bonus, it solved all the DOS hardware hell too.
Anything I tried worked perfectly in a Windows 95 DOS box, so I was done messing with pure DOS mode drivers.
I know it's sacrilege to a lot of folks, but if you've got a Win 9x system and play DOS games, I'd strongly recommend trying things out inside Windows.
It's a whole lot faster than rebooting!</p>
