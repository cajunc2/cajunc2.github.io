		<h1>What's a &quot;PRO-VIDEO&quot;?</h1>
<p>So as per the previous article, I have a working PRO-83 computer.
It does all the things the manual claims it does.</p>
<p>But what about that extra card it came with?</p>
<p>The manual claims the slot on the main unit is an S-100 slot, but a number of the pins carry different signals compared to the S-100 spec.
The card that I have is clearly intended to go with this machine though, so whether it's truly S-100 compatible may not be important at the moment.</p>
<p>So what about that card?</p>
<p><a data-gallery="page-photos" href="/images/pro-83/02-videocard/card.jpg" class="glightbox"><img src="/images/pro-83/02-videocard/small/card.jpg" class="fullwidth-photo" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>It says PRO-VIDEO on it</li>
<li>It has a two-pin connector labeled &quot;TV&quot;</li>
<li>Near the TV connector is an MC6847P video chip and associated circuitry</li>
<li>It's got a handful of pin headers</li>
<li>There's an empty socket</li>
<li>There are three EPROMs labeled U6, U7, and JEU</li>
<li>There are 8 extra SRAM chips</li>
<li>There's a switch labeled +5 and +25</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly there's some video output here, but it seems like a LOT of extra circuitry and memory chips just for that.</p>
<p>At this point in my &quot;career,&quot; I didn't have anything handy that could easily accept what I assumed was an RF signal on the TV connector, so it wasn't as simple as hooking it up and giving it a go.
I'd have to do some digging around &quot;on paper&quot; to get some sense of what's going on.</p>
<p><a data-gallery="page-photos" href="/images/pro-83/02-videocard/tvout.jpg" class="glightbox"><img src="/images/pro-83/02-videocard/small/tvout.jpg" class="fullwidth-photo" /></a></p>
<p>To start, I constructed a crude adapter to read the old 2532 EPROMs and dumped them to my lab PC.
I couldn't make too much sense of the result at first.
It seemed like <em>maybe</em> it was code?
There was a lot of what seemed like junk in there though.</p>
<p><a data-gallery="page-photos" href="/images/pro-83/02-videocard/chipadapter.jpg" class="glightbox"><img src="/images/pro-83/02-videocard/small/chipadapter.jpg" class="fullwidth-photo" /></a></p>
<p>Using the built-in system monitor tool, I was able to locate the memory space for the EPROMs, but something wasn't right.
Big parts of the dump didn't match what I was seeing on the actual system.
There had to be something wrong with my adapter.</p>
<p>Rather than fiddle around with that and risking shorting some pins or otherwise fouling up the irreplaceable EPROMs, I decided to try a different way.
I used an Arduino connected to the parallel IO chip on the PRO-83 to capture data and send it to my PC via the Arduino's serial connection.
After some debugging, I got the PRO-83 program working and dumped the EPROMs to my PC via the Arduino.</p>
<p>Now I had valid ROM dumps and everything matched what I saw on the system itself.
Running them through a Z80 disassembler yielded something that sort of resembled program code, but it would take a lot of work to actually make sense of it. (A topic for a future article, of course)</p>
