		<h1>Hello PRO-83</h1>
<p>This obscure little guy came from my first venture to an actual retro-computing event.
It was the <a href="https://vcfed.org/" target="_blank">Vintage Computer Festival East</a> in October of 2021.
As it was my first event, I was somewhat unsure of what to expect and a little gunshy on actually making some purchases.</p>
<p>I had eyed up a few things, but everything i was interested in was bought by other folks before I could convince myself to pull the trigger.
As the days wore long, I was determined to pick up SOMETHING interesting to take home, even if just as a souvenir!</p>
<p>Perusing one of the booths, a keyboard caught my eye.
I had been looking for something that might work with the project that eventually became <a href="../interis">Interis</a> so I took a closer look.
Along with the keyboard was a CPU Trainer, which i found mildly interesting, particularly because it used a Z80 processor.
The seller couldn't tell me too much about it, just that it was a package deal for the CPU Trainer unit, a mystery expansion card of some sort, the keyboard, and a basic manual.</p>
